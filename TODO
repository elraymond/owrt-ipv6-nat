- all variables used in awk functions are *global* unless declared
  as function parameters; check/modify code accordingly

- seen packets w/ destination address "fd00::1" going out my WAN
  interface; that doesn't really make sense inside my network but
  should be prohibited anyway, possibly by firewall or routing
  rules; application/system misconfiguration?

  ok, those are LAN applications using bogus addresses to open
  connections, has nothing to do with our setup; route
  ip -6 route add unreachable fc00::/7 dev pppoe-wan
  prevents those packets from leaving our network
  DONE
