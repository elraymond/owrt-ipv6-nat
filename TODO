- all variables used in awk functions are *global* unless declared
  as function parameters; check/modify code accordingly

- seen packages w/ destination address "fd00::1" going out my WAN
  interface; that doesn't really make sense inside my network but
  should be prohibited anyway, possibly by firewall or routing
  rules; application/system misconfiguration?
